# What is this blog about


_To blog - To share, To connect, To create, To inspire_

To be honest, i wanted to start my blog in an incredibly attractive way, and so i searched a quote. And.... here we are. A quote i found on google, that makes it seem like my blog has a lot of purpose behind it.
But, how exactly do you make an introduction attractive enough for you to gain enough ad revenue is all i am thinking right now. Enough though is very subjective, for nothing can be enough.

In any case, over time i will try to sell my blog better, but for now this is all i have -

**This is a place for anyone willing to learn and grow with me.**
